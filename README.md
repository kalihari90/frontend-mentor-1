## My process

### Built with

- Basic HTML
- Basic CSS

### What I learned

I've learnt a workflow of the Frontend Mentor challenge. How to prepare for a project and what to do after I finish a code. The challenge was simple, but it was good for warm up. I've had to recall how to use Git and GitHub stuff, which I used before. I used a Figma file to use correct styling. Also this is my first readme.md file, so let's make it a habit, to make one after each project.

### Continued development

In the future I must focus on the good naming of the classes, so I must implement BEM naming convention. This project wasn't demanding so I don't know what can I do more to make my solution to the super ideal perfecto level.
